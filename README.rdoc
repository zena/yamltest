= yamltest

* http://github.com/zena/yamltest/tree

== DESCRIPTION:

yamltest lets you configure unit test with yaml documents. Simply define a "yt_parse" method
that will transform your "src" (source) into a "res" (result).

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Ease of context definition
* Multiple step testing with different keys
* tests are only created if a test with the same name does not exist
* named tests (easy to get information on failed test)

== SYNOPSIS:

  class TestSomething < Test::Unit::TestCase
    yamltest :directories => ["/some/path/for/my/tests"]
    
    def yt_parse(key, source, context)
      do_something_with(source, context)
    end
    
    yt_make
  end

== REQUIREMENTS:

* yaml, test/unit

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install yamltest
